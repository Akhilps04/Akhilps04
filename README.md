# Hi, I'm Akhil 👋

AI-focused engineer with a strong foundation in Electronics and a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence.  
I enjoy building practical systems where machine learning meets real-world constraints.

I focus on clarity, correctness, and end-to-end implementation rather than just model accuracy.
